also given numerical specificationis l'or sueh characterislies as were the

What 1 have often felt as a defieiency is‚ 111111 the authors of

the species-deseriptions within this group. especially during the last
few yet-farsq have 1101 given any specificationis either as to whieh eha-

raetcristics they have considered 10 be siguifieant for the species or
to whieh previously described species the newly described type
might be most closely related. lt has therefore become unnecessarily
tedious to find out from the multitude of the stated characters those
which are specilic 101 1110 species. Because 011111οΙ have added to the
description 01 every new species or variety 11 short summary 111111 dis-
cussion 01 1110 characteristies that Ι have thought to be distinguishing

Sinee the days of the Challeuger papers there are 1011 1101110
that have given any figures of the newly described Crinoids and in
the eases where this bas been done it is almost without exception
only habitus-figures that have been reproduced as drawiugs 0111110100.
