Comaesm is av natural one Ι must leave an open question.

This seems to be the· plaee to mention a young Comasferid
swept from a depth of 400 fallioms in Sagami Bay (Sl. 37). If this
young specimen deseribed below belongs to any previously known
Oomaslerid speeies there are only a few of which one might expect
that it may be a young form7 for flie number of (wjinastoi-ids found
at a depth of more tlian 150 fathoms is only about lo. Since the
proximal segments are rather high and nari-ow and the arm-bases
widely separated, one ean eliminate both tlie musve-deseribed (labaim-ia-
speeies (which are deep-water forms): of the remaining ones ilv
approaehes elosesl fo Ormzatnlcdes <leonium-os, known from great deplhs off
‚Japanese coasts, There is„ however, in the young specimen an im-
portant differenee from this speeies: there are dorsal spines on the
oirrais. lt is however„ rather likely that tho absence. of dorsal spines
is not a primary feature in Contactu![inm. L'nder such circumstances
it is possible that dorsal spines ean appear in the young speeimens
and then again disappear. The formation of the eirrals in the otlier
communiales-species (C. illeso-alis) perhaps also points in this direction:

nultimate have their distal (lorsal margin very slightly tliiekened.»
