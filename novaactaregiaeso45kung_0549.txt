THE CRINOIDS FROM DR. S. Bocn’s EXPEnrmoN 'ro JAPAN 1914. 175»

Ι have therefore preserved the two species as different types
of species value.

The newly proposed form ornam& l might possibly have been
able to consider as a variety, if Ι had had more plentiful material at my
disposal. It differs from the chief speeies by the well developed orna-
mentation os the interuodal joints and, probably„ by a somewhat greater
number of arms (Sp. 22 with about LX arms). Neverfheless it might
be considered that the greater number of arms is a mere chance; cf.
the 20⁸¹ specimen (observe also that Sp. 20—22 are rather large spe-
cimens). Therefore, keeping in view the appearance of the stems in
M. rotundus, Ι will not set up a new variety based only onthe orna-
tion of the internodals and because of that Ι have preferred only
to note the new type as a »form›>.

Ι (10 not consider that the change 111 the number of intci·1i‹„›dals
in the above-described specimcns causes any sub-dividing into varie-
ties. (Sp. 8, 9 and 20 show specially high figures). It 15 10 be noticed
that the very youngest specimens have a smaller number of inter-
nodal joints. That is because the middlemost internodal joints have
got a complete cirrus-whorl. There are often on the other internodals
too small prominences where the cirrus ought to have been inserted
if the Joint had been a nodal. Ι do not doubt that the still unknown,
very small young forms of this family will turn 0111 10 have all or
most internodal joints provided with cirrus-like prominences7 thus
appoaching the type that is shown 111 the distal part of the stems of
Rhizocrimis. The differentiation into nodal and internodal joints is
certainly a second-ary phenomenon. —
