THE CRINOIDS FROM DR. S. Boon's EXPEDITION 'ro -JAPAN 1914. 7

was swept from Sagami at a depth of 209—728 metros. Omnis-Sia gym-
carpes, collected at the Kei-Islands at 11 depth of simssesi metros„ is
found at Sagami at 728 meti-es, C'ssllmtwlm ‹lise-Meivm's· occurs at the
Philippines from 0—325 metres„ at Saganii the species is found from
182-728 metres 111111, finally„ 'sozomen-u at 1110 l'hilippines and the
Sundadslands, where the genus is represented by tho speeies pmcpera,
occurring at a depth of 0—502 metresq was brought home from Saga-
mi from 273 metres.

A woof of southern forms is also visible at the Goto Islands by
the occurrence of the species Cyllometm islant-d„ Psallusmmelra isVsremg
Metacrimts interruptus and M. nobilis var. tenuis.

The Crinoid fauna of the Bonin-Islands was quite unknown be-
fore. The 32 species that have been brought home from these 1511111118,
show that the crinoid fauna forms a mixture between the South dapa-
nese fauna and that of the Sunda Islands and oceania with a woof
of some more peculi-ar and diverging forms. South Japanese speeies
or ones closely related to these are Comulelld brat-hyesme, Conmme- Ser-
o'ala, Oomsmtlzeria maistin-amas, Cgsllonzetra (tmolum-parea, Α311’1·0111611·α (1111-
hus and Sceuometra dentata. Most of the rest are represented by the
same or closely-related forms in the waters round the Sunda iel-ands
and the Philippines or belong to speeies with ubiquitous distribution.
Eucliocrimcs macilis, formerly reported from Burma, is represented by ’
a somewhat diverging form. ef the same genus there is a new spe-
cies Ειι. Loveni, which reminds one both of Eu. ,qt-(mlle and venustnlus,
but is otherwise a special type. lt is strange that a variety of the
East African Omnissz'a {quota is found at the Bonin Islands. As a
parallel in the distribution one might quote Tropiomeira afra and Tro-
piometra afra oncerodzsssrzcs. Both the new genera of the collection also
originate from these islands. The genus Di'cdontometm is a Charito-
metrz'd formq most closely related to Clmrzsstowez‘ra„ 11 genus known from
great depths at the Kermadee and Fiji islands, though the new genus
differs from Cltccritomelra by having XX arms and a double opposing
spine, an almost unparallelled condition„ formerly observed only in the
genus Epimelra fam. Golobomelridw. The new genus Οἴτη-1100161111 is
also interesting especially from an animai-geographieal point of view.
The genus belongs to the subfamily Pet-ommim· of Ansedom‘dw and
is most closely related to the East American genus Hgspcclwzelrd,
