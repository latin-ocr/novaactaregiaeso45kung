age that the present 5110011110115 represent permit a reugh estimate of
the L ef the 510111 in a full-grown specimen. ›S‘stecimeu 3 has a L of the
stem ef 295 mm. and an increase ef 4,3-«5,3 mm. ef the stem-diameter.
Sp. ‘3 has a 240 mm. long 510111 and a diameter ef 4‚5--4‚s mm. Sp. 1
has a Stemlength ef 275 111111. and a stem-diameter of :3„5—4‚5 mm. In
Sp. 8 the stem 011 a L ef 160 mm. has inereased from 2,5-2‚s mm.
and in Sp. ἴ) from Ore-1³3 mm. 011 a L ef 100 111111. Te judge from these
specimens the increase ef the diameter of the stem 15 thus rapid to
