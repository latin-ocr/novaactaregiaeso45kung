THE CRINOIDS FROM DR. S. BocK's EXPEDrrioN To JAPAN 1914. St)

have the most arms, but rather the reverse. lt is prob-able, as Ι have
suggested when treating the above—mentioned species, that the question
of catching the food plays a certain rele, but possibly (though not very
likely, cosidering that Ι have often seen mlupheative» regenerates
situated on ΒΓ 1, but never a single ¹arm regenerated from the same
ossicle) one might also connect the phenomenon with the fact that the
family Colobometretdw strongly tends to a X-armed type and that this
is reached only after a transition stage with more than X arms,

By the small transverse carin-atlon (on some segmentis replaced
by a pair of microscopic tubercles} on the proxima] cirrals the new
⁴species proves itself to be a form of an Oliyoplnesct type, though other-
wise it presents much that reminds ns of certain Percmzetr‘ins lthe rela-
tively large size of the centrodorsal cavity and the position of the
rosette, which only radially forms »spont-like» proeesses).

The new species approaches most to G, ammeca, from which it
differs by a smaller and less discoidal cd„ by longer cirrals‚ which
have only inconspicuous carinations. by the absence of ΙΙΙ ΒΓ-Ξ,
by the short interval between the syzygieS„ and by P.2 being almost
smooth,

The species is an interesting sorim showing a strong tendeney
of convergence towards the Macrophreat type.
