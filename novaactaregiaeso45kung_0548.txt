of the 11 and ΙΙΙ Br-series in the two species. The number of II
Br—st however, in M. rotundus is somewhat more Variablc (2—7—11
-21) than in M. interruptus, wlierQ with rare exception& it stops bet-
ween 9 and ll. Furlher Ι quite agree with SPERRY in his statement
about the variability of the infranodal face.

But -— nevertheless —- there are some differences. In the ori-
ginal specimens of M. rolandus and interruptus there was measured
a stem-diameter of 54] and 435 mm. respectively. This difference
might seem slight7 but my measurements of both the species show that
it is of rather great importanee: only 4 of the 22 specimens of M.
'interruptus have a stem-diameter of more than 4,2 mm„ and these 4,
evidently very old speeimens, do not attain a stem-thickness of more
than [m mm. In M. ‘rotmzdns⁵ on the other hand, there are only 2
specimens (with relatively rapid growth of the stem) which do not coine
up to 6 inm. (CARPENTER'S specimen is evidently to be compared with
the Bockian sp. ἵης all the full-grown onos have a diameter of the
stem of 6„0—6‚7 mm.

M. rotundus is therefore a larger speeies and from this some other
differences also follow. Thus the eii-rals osten number 50—55, eont-
rary to M. laeteri-effla& where they very seldom exceed 45. The inter-
articalnr pores in the latter species disappear at. the 7³¹ or the 8²¹¹ in-

ternodes (seldom at the 9ῒΙΙ or loth). in the former speeies they dis?

appear first at the 9²¹¹-ffl12th internodes.

As to the number of the ossieles in the Ι Br-series a compa-
rison between the two speeies turns out thus: ]ι[.1ὀτιιηᾱ1ις has 7 Ι Br-s
in 2ss cases„ 8 or 5 each in 4 cases: 4, 10 or 12 each in l case. (It
is, however, to be noticed that here are included the figures from the
abnormal Sp. 7). M. interrumpens has 7 I Br-s in 7ss cases, Sin 5 cases,
5 and 6 each in 2 case& -l and 9 each in l case. (Here the young
specimen 16„ however. contributes 3 figures differing from 7). Thus
it is impossible to deny that in M. rotundus there is a somewhat greater
variability in the number of the I Br—s.

The cirri extend over 212'2—372 internodes in inmolandus, over
l¹l2-—2²l3 internodes‚ only exeeptionally over 3 internodes‚ in M. inter-
ruptus (sp. ll. 21). (The last-mentioned L only occurs in the largest
speeimens).
