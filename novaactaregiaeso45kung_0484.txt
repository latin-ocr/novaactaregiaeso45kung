With regard to A. lepida it is also 31111011 111111 (jd should have 11 spe-

subject to great variation. l have selected sp. 18* 27 and 34 to be

of 70 mm. 111111 is therefore of the 3111110 sizo as the single specimen
of A. lepidio found„ has a 31111111, 0111110111 1’11 with relativer small cirrus-
sooliets. od of sp. 27 (arm-length 85 mm.) is a transition-form to t'd
of Sp. lb' (arm-length loo mm.) which is of typical A. (millitis-(crestal
formation.

As all transitiissms between these two types are found among

Finally some words about the above-described very young spe-

already observed by P. H. CARPENTER. Perhaps one 1111113 this fact
